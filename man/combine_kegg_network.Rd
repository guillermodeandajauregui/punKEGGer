\title{Combine KEGG group and relation edges into a tidygraph}
\usage{
combine_kegg_network(kgml)
}
\arguments{
\item{kgml}{A parsed XML document from \code{xml2::read_xml()}.}
}
\value{
A \code{tidygraph} object with all edges from the KGML and nodes carrying \code{meta_id}.
}
\description{
Parses both standard KEGG relations and intra-group edges, and builds a directed tidygraph.
Also assigns meta_id to each node: either its group_id (if in a group) or its own ID.
}
\examples{
kgml_file <- system.file("extdata", "hsa04210.xml", package = "punKEGGer")
doc <- xml2::read_xml(kgml_file)
g <- combine_kegg_network(doc)
print(g)
igraph::gorder(g)
